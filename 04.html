            <h2>Sick love - Red Hot Chili Peppers</h2>
            <p>Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
                California dreamin' is a Pettibon
                LA's screaming you're my home
                Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
                I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
                Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there
                I don't know but it's been said
                Your heart is stronger than your head
                And this location is my home
                Stick 'n move you're living in a quick world
                Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
                Born into it that's for sure
                Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected, well
                Sick love comes to wash us away
                Prisons of perspective
                How your vision gets corrected and
                Sick love is my modern cliché
                People talk and tell you what you want to hear
                Do you really need another souvenir
                Super heroes tend to disappear
                Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
                Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
                Chase your tail my baby it'll be your last
                I don't know but it's been said
                Your heart is stronger than your head
                And this location is my home
                Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected, well
                Sick love comes to wash us away
                Prisons of perspective
                How your vision gets corrected and
                Sick love is my modern cliché
                Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected, well
                Sick love comes to wash us away
                Prisons of perspective
                How your vision gets corrected and
                Sick love is my modern cliché
                Openly defective is the lover you elected and
                A portrait she was bound to portray

        <h2>Last night on earth - Green day</h2>
        <p>I text a postcard, sent to you
            Did it go through?
            Sending all my love to you
            You are the moonlight of my life every night
            Giving all my love to you
            My beating heart belongs to you
            I walked for miles 'til I found you
            I'm here to honor you
            If I lose everything in the fire
            I'm sending all my love to you
            With every breath that I am worth
            Here on Earth
            I'm sending all my love to you
            So if you dare to second guess
            You can rest assure
            That all my love's for you
            My beating heart belongs to you
            I walked for miles 'til l found you
            I'm here to honor you
            If I lose everything in the fire
            I'm sending all my love to you
            My beating heart belongs to you
            I walked for miles 'til I found you
            I'm here to honor you
            If I lose everything in the fire
            Did I ever make it through</p>

            <h2>Dream on - aerosmith</h2>
            <p>Every time that I look in the mirror
                All these lines on my face getting clearer
                The past is gone
                Oh, it went by like dusk to dawn
                Isn't that the way?
                Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, oh, oh, oh
                I know nobody knows
                Where it comes and where it goes
                I know it's everybody's sin
                You got to lose to know how to win
                Half my life's in books' written pages
                Storing facts learned from fools and from sages
                You view the earth
                Oh, sing with me, this mournful dub
                Sing with me, sing for a year
                Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear
                Sing with me, if it's just for today
                Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
                Oh, sing with me, sing for the year
                Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear
                Sing it with me, if it's just for today
                Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
                Dream on
                Dream on
                I dream on
                Dream a little, I'll dream on
                Dream on
                I dream on
                I dream on
                Dream a little, I'll dream on
                Dream on
                Dream on
                Dream on
                I'll dream on
                Dream on
                Dream on
                I dream on</p>
